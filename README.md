I built this little game in an attempt to learn RxJS. This is still very much work in progress and despite some refactoring the code is still very messy, but my goal was achievied -- I'm not scared of RxJS anymore.

You can **[play the game here](https://filipkrw.github.io/dodge-game/)**. Bear in mind, it works properly on desktop only.
